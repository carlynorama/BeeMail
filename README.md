BeeMail
=======

Scratch pad for the BeeMail Project.  This Repo is a work in progress.

This project is meant to be a "Hello World" for the Intel Gallileo board, although it may move platforms as time goes on.

It is based on Intel's resources ( http://www.intel.com/support/galileo/ ) as well has two SparkFun resources:

- Galileo Getting Started Guide, https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/galileo-getting-started-guide
- Enginursday: Exploring the Arduino/Intel Galileo, https://www.sparkfun.com/news/1360#comments
